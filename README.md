# todo_app_react
Here is a robust todo app built with React Js and use Django api and db.sqlite3.
I will use postgresql in next version.

Project: ReactJS + Django Integration
Welcome to the ReactJS + Django Integration project! This project aims to demonstrate the seamless integration of the ReactJS frontend library with the Django backend framework. By combining these two powerful technologies, we can build modern web applications that offer a dynamic user interface and robust backend capabilities.

Project Overview
In this project, we have created a web application that leverages the strengths of both ReactJS and Django. The frontend is built using ReactJS, which provides a component-based architecture for creating interactive and reusable UI components. On the other hand, Django, a high-level Python web framework, handles the backend logic, database management, and routing.

Features
ReactJS Frontend:

Utilizes the power of React's virtual DOM for efficient rendering and updates.
Implements a responsive and user-friendly interface using various React components.
Manages state and handles user interactions using React's state management.
Django Backend:

Sets up a robust backend server using Django, handling API requests and responses.
Defines models to interact with the database and manages data using Django's ORM.
Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure user access.
Demonstrates routing and URL handling through Django's URL patterns.
